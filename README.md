### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Susan, an independent designer, and front-end developer. I'm based in San Francisco and work with people everywhere.

I'm passionate about designing and building compelling web experiences and products. I love innovative digital design.

I want to collaborate and work on web projects, design systems, and product design.

My background is in software development; I've always been interested in user interfaces (UI) and usability. I worked on early 3D interfaces and am more excited than ever about the ability of design and content to engage, entertain and educate. I have built many websites and apps. 

I lived in NYC for a year and loved the energy there. I've also fallen in love with London, Paris, and Berlin.

**2022 Projects & Update**

I'm currently designing an IoT dashboard in Figma and using Webflow for interactive storytelling. Webflow allows me to move fast, add custom code when needed, and the community is friendly and collaborative.
